feature_selection_clustering
============================

This repository contains code for the project that compares feature selection methods for unsupervised learning

This project compares 4 different types of feature selection algorithms for unsupervised learning: clustvarsel, vscc, sparseKmeans and simplified silhouette based

The project used the clusterGeneration package to generate the data sets to compare the algorithms

All the code was made using the R language
